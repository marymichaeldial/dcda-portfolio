            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                For this lab, I experimented with two different AI tools by asking thought provoking and interesting questions. I explored ChatGPT (text/chat assistant) and Canva Magic Studio (presentation and design). My goal was not to produce outputs I would normally favor, but to probe the assumptions built into these tools and push them beyond their typical uses. This project was intended to observe where they succeeded, failed, or revealed hidden constraints. I intentionally used unconventional and creatively misaligned prompts to better understand how these systems can shape digital usage.

            <h2>Tool 1: ChatGPT (Text / Chat Assistant)</h2>
            <h3>What I Tried</h3>
            <p>
                I experimented with ChatGPT by giving it prompts that were deliberately ambiguous or subjective, such as asking it to analyze “vibes” in contemporary digital culture or to explain a concept without relying on standard academic language. I asked ChatGpt these two questions: "Tell me things about myself that I may not know based off of all of our conversations before." and "If I were self-sabotaging without realizing it, how might I be doing that?"

    <figcaption>I feel that asking AI to pick apart my behaviors and critique my self-awareness is a bit unsettling, but it's also fascinating to see what it picks up on. Using AI reveals hidden opinions and patterns from my own subconscious.</figcaption>

            <h3>What Happened</h3>
            <p>
                ChatGPT performed well when generating structured explanations and reflective commentary, even from loosely defined prompts. It was especially effective at adopting an analytical tone and producing coherent narratives quickly. However, it struggled with maintaining internal consistency when prompts became contradictory. In some cases, it confidently generated plausible-sounding responses that were overly generalized, revealing a tendency to prioritize fluency over precision.

    <figcaption>I was surprised by how much ChatGPT knew about me, even though I had never explicitly told it about my personal life. It seemed to be able to make inferences from the conversation history that I hadn't even realized I had shared.</figcaption>
            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>
                These experiments revealed that ChatGPT assumes users want clarity, structure, and resolution, even when uncertainty might be more appropriate. The tool tends to “smooth over” ambiguity rather than sit with it. This highlights a key limitation: while ChatGPT is useful for brainstorming and drafting, it may obscure uncertainty or disagreement if used uncritically.
            </p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>
Using AI to pick apart personal behaviors raises important ethical questions and concerncs. I do not share every aspect of my life with AI, so this information is heavily inaccurate and should not be relied on.

            <h2>Tool 2: Canva Magic Studio (Presentation & Design)</h2>
            <h3>What I Tried</h3>
            <p>
                With Canva Magic Studio, I attempted to generate presentation slides for abstract or unconventional topics. My topic included "Design a presentation for a concept that doesn't exist yet."
            </p>

    <figcaption>This shows the output of Canva Magic Studio when I asked it to generate a presentation for a concept that doesn't exist yet.</figcaption>
            <h3>What Happened</h3>
            <p>
                Canva Magic Studio quickly produced visually polished images and layouts that were consistent with my vague and imaginative prompt. with consistent typography and color schemes. However, the content itself lacked depth and relied on sshort buzzwords and guess-work to create a lenghty presentation. 
            </p>

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>
               Canva is best used for creating presnetations and infrographics when given clear and very specific instructions. It lacks the ability to create authentic and new ideas without heavily inputting information. The visuals, color scheme, and layout were pleasing though.
            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>

    <figcaption>It was interesting to see how Canva Magic Studio generated an idealized world. I wouldn't have expected this promopt to create a dystopian society.</figcaption>
                Canva raises questions about authorship and originality, especially when AI-generated designs are presented as personal work. I believe there are implications for transparency in academic and professional contexts when using Canva because of its' lack of statements around human or AI based content.

            <h2>Broader Reflections</h2>
            <p>
                Through these experiments, I saw many insightful strengths and limitations of AI tools. It was interesting to see the feedback ChatGPt could present me on my subconscious behaviors, but I also beileve its notable to mention the lack of accuracy and depth in responses (that is not accounted for). Canva Magic Studio developed interesting and creative visuals to create an easy and flowing presentation. But without adding in. extremely clear instructions and insight into what the goal of the presenation was, it lacked insgihtful depth. Canva poses a major ethical conc
