            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>
This artwork shows the feedback from a survey on what makes people happy. The data is very concise and straightforward, representing the most common answers from largest to smallest. This treemap visualization works to correspond feedback with percentage values taken from the study, however, clarity in overall execution arises. The two largest categories dominate the picture so they appear much larger than their actual number of responses. The remaining categories and pushed together on the left hand side, making them seem weak or negligible when that is not the case.

            <h3>
 
Aesthetic Appeal vs. Obscurement</h3>
            <p>One of the initial aspects that drew me to this graph was overall coloring and visual appeal. While the gradient coloring works nicely, there was a missed opportunity in distinguishing individual and social sources of happiness like discussed in the article. In addition, there is no indication of progression or relationship between categories, causing a lack of depth in factors. 
                The largest two categories dominate the screen, causing differentiation between the smaller categories to be lost and confusing. Achievement and affection appear to be the main sources of happiness, creating a potential loss of importance that is not necessarily true from the other categories. 
</p>

            <h3>Emotional Engagement vs. Manipulation </h3>
            <p>
The work creates exciting and positive emotions, creating an inviting visualization and basic readability. The title is uplifting and inviting, accompanied by soothing colors. The usage of the treemap and sizing of the graph work to show the more common categories of wellbeing, but this causes a strain for the smaller categories. That being said, there are small shortcomings in the clarity of sources of happiness. It can lack a certain level of transparency by implying sources of happiness should be coming from only a few categories. By pushing a feel-good narrative, it encourages agreement rather than sparking critical thinking. Overall, by highlighting and promoting the importance of a non-material lifestyle, the message is positive and insightful. 

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>This graph works to create an engaging and reflective visualization over the most common sources of happiness in everyday life. It’s a clear and concise way to represent the given data, but sacrifices important information for aesthetic appeal. I see this piece working better as an inspirational piece, promoting wellbeing over materialistic desires. While it’s appealing,  and thought-provoking, the messaging is still shallow on overall insight about human happiness.
